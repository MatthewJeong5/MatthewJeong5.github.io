This repository contains my twine narrative surrounding a key figure from the English Reformation, King Henry VIII. Itâ€™s set out as a role playing game where you are in the perspective of King Henry VIII making decisions based on historic events that have occurred in the English Reformation. The passages in the narrative contain other figures as well such as Catherine of Aragon and Anna Boleyn. This twine narrative has advanced functions to make it more engaging to the audience. This narrative contains numerous multimedia, stylized texts, conditionals, variables and the use of user input.
